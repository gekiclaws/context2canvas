# Bar Charts
- Bar charts should **never** have more than 15 bars -- except for ordinal data (i.e. tracking data daily across a year)
- When using a high number of bars (i.e > 8), never use multiple colors to represent each bar, unless you're using shades of the same color to represent a gradient
- Make sure tick labels never overlap
- Make sure, if a bar graph has tick markers, each tick marker is clearly centered between the bounds of the corresponding bar
- Make sure value labels clearly correspond to each bar
- Only add gradients for continuous variables or ordinal data

# Scatterplots
- Use as few categories as possible. If you a large number of categories, try to group them up via clear, common themes
- Make sure the alpha value of each data is not exactly one. In other words, make sure each dot is not completely opaque
- Do not use gradients for discrete categories. Make sure that the differences between each category is easily noticeable
